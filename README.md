# BlockBuilder

BlockBuilder is a bare-bones Tetris clone written to help familiarize myself with tkinter.

## Requirements

BlockBuilder was written on Python 3.4 and relies on the built-in tkinter package. No external packages are required.

## Changelog
### Initial: v0.1
Core gameplay is functional; currently lacking support for recognizing game-over and for counting points.
